# Hyrox Data Analysis

Project building on work from: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jgug05/hyrox-data-scraping

Main objectives are:
  - extracting insights into what separates the best Hyrox racers from the rest
  - are there any hyrox events that are more significant to the overall race result than others?
  - do different hyrox regions have specific focuses?
  - how can we train in a more informed way through analysing the race results of some of the elite athletes in Hyrox?
